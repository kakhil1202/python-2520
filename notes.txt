### **BACKEND - PYTHON**
Class-1 Intro


##### **Hardware spec:**

1. i5/i3 processor
2. 8GB Ram
3. 500GB HDD 



##### **Software spec:**

1. Setup Python (python.org)
2. IDE: Integrated Development Environment (Visual studio code) for writing code
3. Version Control System: Helps you keep track of code

       a) In version control the project is called as repository(Holds project code + Tracking history)

       b) Changes: Commits

       c) System we use,

   

           1) Git: Client Software installed in developer laptop, to start tracking code

           2) GitHub: Platform which enables to store Source code (github.com)

  

        d) Workflow:

    

            1) As a developer you create an account on GitHub (github.com)

            2) On GitHub we create Repository (Remote Repository) - Unique URL

            3) Clone (Remote Repository) using - Unique URL

              -> Clone(Copying) to laptop i.e project is copied inside your laptop

            4) project is copied inside your laptop - Local Repository

            5) First Clone --> Local Repository == Remote Repository

Class-2


--> Any Programming language has syntax (Rules & Guidelines)
--> Comparing a language like English with Python
    -> English has 26 Alphabets
    -> Python has keywords
--> Keywords: Predefined words, which holds special meaning to python Interpreter
     -> List of keywords: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords
     -> We have 35 keywords
           
             False      await      else       import     pass
             None       break      except     in         raise
             True       class      finally    is         return
             and        continue   for        lambda     try
             as         def        from       nonlocal   while
             assert     del        global     not        with
             async      elif       if         or         yield

--> Keywords + Syntax = Program/Application
--> NOTE: Keywords cannot be used as identifiers
